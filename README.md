Who are we? We are the Bit4life, a company created by a few friends with an idea born during a Bitcoin Hackathon, aiming to support all of the BTC community to reach autonomy and freedom to choose what will happen with your Bitcoin  after, you know…. Kick the bucket? meet the grim reaper? or in a gentle manner, when you pass away. 

What happens with someone’s Bitcon if this person dies? Well, we know the answer so let us tell you! Those bitcoins will stay forever on the person’s wallets in an unreachable, untouchable and inaccessible way until the end of the world. 
Dramatic right? But calm down, it doesn’t have to be like that and that is why we’re here :) 

How it works?
When hiring our services you will have a transaction using timeblock “scheduled” 12 months ahead of the agreement with our service, you will be able to select and inform us the one wallet ID address you’d like to receive all of your Bitcoins after the predetermined period. If you want to cancel the transaction scheduled as the owner of the wallet you have total autonomy to do it and we can support you at this process if opted for it. 

Why we do what we do?
We believe that all of the Bitcoin community which has any amount of bitcoin in your wallet must have the right and freedom to choose what will happen, or who might inherit those coins if the one pass away, this service is for everyone who has someone it would like to bestow and redirect your coins, for family, friends, NGOs, miners, it doesn’t matter who, where, or when. 

If you have a wallet plus bitcoins, and well, you are still alive. we’re here to help you with that succession plan, after all, life is unpredictable and who wouldn’t like to have a plan B right?
